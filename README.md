## Project Overview
Welcome to the Earth Observation Data Visualization Challenge! The primary objective of this challenge is to create a visualization using Earth observation data that contributes to at least one of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Zero Hunger (Goal 2), Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6), or Climate Action (Goal 13). 

## Dataset Selection
For our project, we focused on the "Zero Hunger" dataset, aligning with SDG Goal 2. This dataset provides crucial insights into undernourishment across various regions and countries. We accessed the data from a U.S. government agency, ensuring compliance with competition requirements.

# Visualization Creation

## Tools Used
- Python: We utilized Python for accessing the data and generating interactive visualizations.
- Plotly: The Plotly library was employed for creating aesthetic and interactive visuals.
- Tableau and Power BI: For enhancing the visual appeal and creating the final submission, we moved with Tableau.
  
## Steps Taken
- Dataset Identification: We selected the "Zero Hunger" dataset, focusing on the prevalence of undernourishment (% of the population) as a key indicator.
-  Data Access: The data was accessed through a publicly available, adhering to competition guidelines.
- Visualization Generation: We used Python and Plotly to generate interactive visualizations. Additionally, Tableau and Power BI were employed to create visually appealing dashboards and final submissions.

## Visualization Types
Our submission includes a variety of visualization types, including choropleth maps, animated choropleth maps, and enhanced choropleth maps with Mapbox integration. These visuals aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the undernourishment scenario globally. Our final submission is through tableau, which shows detailed results to get insights.

## Decision or Action Informed
The visualizations aim to inform decisions or actions related to addressing undernourishment issues, contributing to the broader goal of achieving Zero Hunger (SDG 2). Policymakers, researchers, and the general public can use these visuals to identify regions in need of targeted interventions and track progress over time.
